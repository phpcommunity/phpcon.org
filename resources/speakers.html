				<h3><a name="lerdorf">Rasmus Lerdorf</a></h3>
                                <p>Rasmus Lerdorf is known for having gotten the PHP project off the ground in 1995 and has contributed to a number of other open source projects over the years. He was most recently an infrastructure architect at Yahoo! for more than 7 years before joining WePay in 2010.

				<h3><a name="chay">Terry Chay</a></h3>
				<p>If Zend puts your picture on a deck of cards, you’ve either arrived in the PHP world or are a terrorist. Terry Chay is a PHP Terrorist. He works on Wordpress, and, when he isn’t doing that, he’s trying to get as much power as you’ll give him saying outrageous things on his blog—which is sort of also like working on Wordpress.</p>
				<p>In previous lives he architected the third largest social network in the U.S. in PHP, developed the largest revenue-generating product in PHP for Plaxo (later purchased by Comcast) as their first web engineer, programmed the communication layer between an internet-enabled home control device and the web browser, voice portals, PDAs and cell phones via SOAP and XMLRPC in PHP, and built the first travel search engine in… PHP (surprise)!</p>
				<p>He gives seminars in PHP development, which is really just a veiled excuse to play with Keynote.</p>
				
				<h4>Living Without Your Linemen</h4>
				<p>If a website architect is the quarterback, then site operations is the offensive line—overworked, underappreciated, and only noticed when it fails. They make you look good. However, four years ago cloud computing networks like Amazon Web Services and Slicehost have appeared. While deficiencies in frameworks in other languages have forced those worlds to adopt Infrastructure-as-a-Service, the PHP world—with it’s ultra-cheap shared-hosting (on one end) and tradition of dominance on some of the most trafficked websites (on the other)—has been slow to move. But as the technology continues to disrupt, modern web engineers will be expected to use their programming skills to not only build, but also provision and maintain fast, scalable websites.</p>

				<p>The efficiencies of a web-based language and experience in scalable website architecture offer a unique opportunity for programmers to transfer their skills when wearing a sysop hat. Not to mention some of the best libraries for programming them are written in PHP! When going from a small pet project to a go-live site, maybe we can learn to live without our linemen.</p>

				<h3><a name="cornutt">Chris Cornutt</a></h3>
				<p>Chris has been involved with PHP and its community for about ten years now, most of that running his site, <a href="http://phpdeveloper.org">PHPDeveloper.org</a> - a site devoted to bringing the most up-to-date, informative news and community happenings to the forefront and, more recently, <a href="http://joind.in/">Joind.in</a>, a community conference feedback service. He's a co-organizer of his local PHP user group (DallasPHP), a Zend Certified Engineer and currently works developing web applications and APIs for a large hosting company in Dallas, TX.</p>
				<h4>It's Not Just About the News</h4>
				<p><a href="http://phpdeveloper.org/">PHPDeveloper.org</a> has always been a way to share the heartbeat of the PHP community with the world. Out of such a simple concept has come a resource that's valuable and respected by the community as a leading news source. It broadens its readers horizons and gives them glimpses into things outside of the PHP bubble.</p>

				<p>Join me on a trip through the history of this simple site, some of the major changes it's making the community a better place to learn and grow.</p>

				<h3><a name="denker">Laura Beth Lincoln Denker</a></h3>
				<p>Laura Beth "LB" Lincoln graduated from RIT with a BS/MS in Computational Mathematics/Computer Science.  She then moved on to a small job in a small city in central New York before being courted by Google, bringing her to the Big Apple, where she worked in both test and development for over 4 years.  Now she has taken a turn for the handmade, helping Etsy grow by creating tools developers need to produce and deploy features faster than ever.</p>
				<h4>Is It Handmade Code If You Use Power Tools?</h4>
				<p>At Etsy we view Code as Craft (check out our blog: <a href="http://codeascraft.etsy.com">codeascraft.etsy.com</a>), and we pride ourselves on enabling every developer to deliver his or her code to the Etsy community as quickly as possible, in our case, around 20 minutes from code completion.  Four months prior to Cyber Monday 2010, there might have been a day where as many as 10 deployments occurred, but the Thursday before Thanksgiving, the prelude to the biggest day for an e-commerce website, Etsy engineers managed 40 deployments in a single day, and each deployment included passing a battery of 5000+ tests.  We would like to share with you how we are approaching internal tooling, abusing PHPUnit, pushing beyond the boundaries of Hudson CI, and creating metrics to guide the future of our continuous deployments while keeping it handmade.</p>

				<h3><a name="esser">Marcel Esser</a></h3>
				<p>Marcel Esser is Vice President of Engineering at CROSCON, a NY-based custom solutions provider. He avoided becoming a college drop-out by never going in the first place, and has a deep love for craftsmanship in both beer and software. He’s been working with PHP since 2000, and originally hails from Germany. He thinks software should be simple, and wants to talk to you about your car. He also likes other languages, like Python and C#.</p> 			
				<h4>From Earth to Jupiter With NASA</h4>
				<p>The Internet is the greatest communications tool in the history of man-kind. Perversely, it's still incredibly difficult for people to communicate complicated ideas. Now, imagine being NASA, and needing to communicate your ideas. In this talk, we'll explore how we exploited the different learning types, together with a rich multimedia CMS, to allow NASA to explain complicated scientific ideas on multiple levels, allowing every member of their audience to walk away with an effective level of understanding. Moreso, we'll be exploring how a rich platform allowed us to easily combine different types of media in combinations rarely found on the web today. In addition, we'll be taking a brief look at what we needed to make this all happen from a technical perspective.</p>

				<h3><a name="finker">Ed Finkler</a></h3>
				<p>I’m a PHP and JavaScript dork. I made Spaz, an open source microblogging client for desktop and HP Palm webOS. My turn-ons include open source, web runtimes platforms, and RESTful APIs. I’m currently working with Fictive Kin, and you can catch me on Twitter, where I’m @funkatron.</p>
				<h4>The Story of Spaz</h4>
				<p>What motivates us as developers? How do we define success? Throughout the development of Spaz, we’ve learned a lot about what works, what doesn’t, and what really matters. Come to hear the story, and participate in the discussion of how we define success in open source.</p>
				<p>Spaz is a mature, open source, free desktop and mobile client for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Palm webOS. Started in Spring of 2007, Spaz is one of the oldest Twitter clients available still under active development. Other systems have gone on to great commercial and popular success, but Spaz still continues to plug along, driven by a commitment to open standards, transparency, and community.</p>
				<p>This talk will cover the history of Spaz’s development, from early successes and awards, to competition from well-funded closed source projects, to the transition onto mobile, and finding a sustainable niche where it continues to grow.</p>

				<h3><a name="mclellan">Drew McLellan</a></h3>
				<p>Drew McLellan is Director and Senior Developer at UK web development agency <a href="http://edgeofmyseat.com">edgeofmyseat.com</a>, and lead developer for their small content management system, Perch. Prior to this, he was a Web Developer for Yahoo!, and from 2006-08 was Group Lead for The Web Standards Project. Drew has had articles published by A List Apart, Adobe, and O'Reilly Media, and writes at his personal site <a href="http://allinthehead.com">http://allinthehead.com</a> and, with a little help from his friends, at <a href="http://24ways.org">http://24ways.org</a>.</p>
				<h4>The Original Hypertext Preprocessor</h4>
				<p>With all the technical considerations of designing and shipping PHP-based software, it's easy to forget how every line of code you write can have a direct impact on your customers. Almost any code has the potential to shape the user experience and result in repeat custom or an over-subscribed helpdesk. Allow Drew McLellan to take you through the lessons learned when building Perch - a PHP content management system that banks heavily on providing a great user experience. Hear what has worked, what failed miserably, and how a goal of eliminating all support requests has driven the technical design of the product.</p>

				<h3><a name="reinheimer">Paul Reinheimer</a></h3>
                                <p>Paul Reinheimer is a PHP developer living in Montréal, Quebec Canada. His business cards read: Photographer, Programmer, Baker. Most everyone is struck by one of the three terms.</p>
                                <h4>XHProf and WonderProxy</h4>
                                <p>I have two stories to tell and but one hour to fill, with luck I’ll weave them together as seamlessly as PHP’s parameter orders. The first is the story of <a href="https://wonderproxy.com/">WonderProxy</a> a company I co-founded with a long time colleague to provide a way to test GeoIP applications. My goal with the story isn’t to sell you a product, far from it, but to talk about it’s underpinnings in PHP, and the success and failure we’ve experienced thus far. One of our failures was our incredibly slow website, luckily <a href="https://github.com/facebook/xhprof">XHProf</a> & <a href="https://github.com/preinheimer/xhprof">XHGui</a> helped us diagnose those issues (notice that excellent segue?). XHProf is a performance analysis tool released by facebook to aid developers by allowing them to profile production runs of their application. XHGui is a user interface for this information, allowing developers easy access to their information, providing graphs over time and other useful displays. This second story will dig through the reason behind the creation of this GUI, and a few useful hints on how to get the most out of it.</p>

				<h3><a name="zmievski">Andrei Zmievski</a></h3>
				<p>Andrei Zmievski is a developer with almost 15 years of experience in the Web. He has worked at Digg at Yahoo and co-founded Analog Coop to work on exciting projects such as Mapalong and Brooklyn Beta. As a core developer of PHP, he helped curate development of the world's most popular web platform. Along the way he started PHP-GTK and Smarty projects, co-wrote PHP Developer's Cookbook, and spearheaded the attempt to bring Unicode and i18n support to PHP. He loves good beer, brews some of his own, and can heartily recommend Russian River Pliny the Elder.</p>
				<h4>The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly: What Happened to Unicode in PHP 6</h4>
				<p>In the halcyon days of early 2005, a project was launched to bring long overdue native Unicode and internationalization support to PHP. It was deemed so far reaching and important that PHP needed to have a version bump. After more than 4 years of development, the project (and PHP 6 for now) was shelved. This talk will introduce Unicode and i18n concepts, explain why Web needs Unicode, why PHP needs Unicode, how we tried to solve it (with examples), and what eventually happened. No sordid details will be left uncovered.</p>

				<h4>Web Services</h4>
				<p>Come along to this in-depth session covering all aspects of web services; if you want to bring your laptop and "play along" as we go, you can grab the sample code and join in!  We will cover the concepts behind web services: data formats, service types, HTTP, troubleshooting, and how to put all this together in PHP to consume services.  Finally we'll go a step further and implement a service ourselves.  Expect anecdotes, war stories and some commandments for things you should never do when working with services.</p>

				<h3><a name="perras">Joël Perras</a></h3>
				<p>Joël is a CakePHP core alumni and a founding developer of <a href="http://li3.rad-dev.org/">Lithium</a>, a web application framework that hopefully doesn't suck. Joël is also a self-proclaimed über-nerd, and a data junkie - in his free time, he tries to make sense of the tangled, wonderful mess that is today's web.</p> 			
				<h4>Lithium</h4>
				<p>Frameworks come in all shapes and sizes, with some touting themselves as being "lightweight" or "micro-frameworks", and others brand themselves as a more "full-stack" solution. With Lithium, a new PHP 5.3+ framework, there's nothing stopping you from having both. In this tutorial, we explore how to trim down lithium to a lightweight, highly performant RESTful JSON &amp; XML API that can fit in a single file. No hair-pulling required.</p>

				<h4>Frontend Caching &mdash; The New Frontier</h4>
				<p>You have done all the caching tricks in the book on the server side, memcache, apc, database cache and so on and squeezed every millisecond out of it, now your site is as fast as it will ever get. Well guess again!</p>
				<p>Too often people forget that what you are effectively caching and creating with those technologies is the HTML part of the user response time, now if they are done correctly then HTML is 10 - 20% of your users response time, so there is room for a whole lot of improvements on those other 80 - 90%</p>
				<p>You will be taken through a couple of important steps to achieve this, such as how to optimize your JavaScript, CSS, Images, Cookies and a whole sleeve of other things that make frontend caching the magical place that it is.</p>
				<p>After having attended this talk you will not only have learned to make your sites faster for your long term users but also people coming for the first time as well as people on slower connections.</p>

				<h4>Mastering Zend Framework 2 Patterns</h4>
				<p>Zend Framework 2 development centers around identifying common themes and patterns our devleopers are using, unifying them, and providing low-level patterns to use everywhere.</p>
				<p>In this tutorial, we will look at a number of these patterns, identifying them, and discussing the interfaces involved and the concrete use cases shipped in ZF2. We'll also show how you might create your own implementations and slip-stream them into your application. Amongst the patterns discussed will be events, brokers, and dispatchers. By the end of the tutorial, you should have a solid understanding of the fundamental patterns found in Zend Framework 2, where and why they are used, and how you can leverage them within your applications.</p>
