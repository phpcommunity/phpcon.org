                <h2>Sponsorship Prospectus</h2>
                <p>Instead of just collecting money in exchange for ad space, we want to take the opportunity to get to know our sponsors. We figure that this is our chance to create partnerships with people who believe in our mission, so raising the PHP community's awareness of our sponsors should be just be the beginning. Ultimately, it's our goal to find creative ways to help each other and enrich the conference experience for our attendees. This said, speaking opportunities at the conference will be evaluated independently of sponsorships or other considerations (<em>speaking slots are not for sale</em>).</p> 
                <p>To sponsor us, please send email to <a href="mailto:sponsors@phpcon.org">sponsors@phpcon.org</a>.</p>
